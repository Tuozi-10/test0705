Daminga is a typeface with an understated presence, ideal for a wide range of applications.

This sans-serif font is built with geometric and smooth shapes. It's neutral but far from boring, with subtle detailing that gives it a sophisticated look. It's well-suited for anything from body text to headlines, branding to posters. Imagine it gracing the pages of a modern magazine, the label of a high-end product, or the interface of a minimalist app.

Daminga contains 16 styles, from Thin to ExtraBold, providing a complete palette for typographic expression. Each weight has a corresponding italic version, ensuring flexibility. 

Additionally, the family is complemented by a Variable font style, allowing you to seamlessly adjust weight and style for ultimate flexibility and customization. Only one font file, but the file contains multiple styles. 
Use the sliders in Illustrator, Photoshop or InDesign to manually set any weight. 

Daminga is built with advanced OpenType functionality and guaranteed top-notch quality, containing stylistic and contextual alternates, ligatures and more automatic and manual features; all to give you full control and customizability.
